# Final Projects

5-minute [lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)

## Monday, June 3

 - **Polygons** (Mary & Rebecca): 2d polygon class, intersections, areas, etc.; done currently by the Sage Polyhedral class.  Improve documentation.

 - **Billera-Lee Polytopes** (Jose): Construct Billera-Lee polytopes (for Ph.D. research) using combination of Sage and polymake... but Sage has a lot hidden for this.

 - **The Simplex Algorithm** (Andrea): Simplex algorithm for optimization.   (cvxopt package; always give inputs like float(2.3) rather than 2.3; or put percent "python")

 - **A Simplex Algorithm tutorial** (Brian & Mellisa): simplex algorithm, min/max; TUTORIAL. Graphically visualize each step.

 - **Optimization** (Gary): Optimization.  Making some functionality of cvxopt more user friendly...

 - **Thin SVD** (Taylor & James): thin SVD (remove some columns); something new

## Wednesday, June 5

 - **Black-Scholes** (Brian Manion)

 - **Markov Process** (Mark): raw data; updating transitional matrix.  markov process.  (see stats.hmm)

 - **Real World Graphs** (Clara): Sage graphs using "real world" data.

 - **Statistics Data** (Tian Yu): Sage/Python <---> statistics data.  Given a bunch of data, you give feedback. Consider <http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/> which is in cloud.sagemath.

 - **Game of GO AI** (Sean & Alex & Daae): game of GO AI;   human versus computer.

 - **Tic-Tac-Toe** (Jasper): AI engine for 2-player game. Implement n x m tic-tac-toe *and* obstacles.  Find the best move.

## Friday, June 7

 - **Musical Tempered Scale** (Kippy):  make your own musical scale.

 - **The Golden Ratio** (Trevor): exploring `golden_ratio`

 - **Improve logic.py** (Dwight & Tannor): the logic.py file (beginner sage tickets).

 - **Logic** (Jessica, maybe group of 3): logic (?)

 - **Challenge Problems** (Hon, Hao, Wu, Qian):
  1. challenge problem -- pos integer in binary; put + digits in compute sum, get another binary number.  Is there a number  c so that any number goes to 1 in at most c steps.
  2. Computing Fermat points -- m points in R^d; find one point so that the sum of the distance to the m points is minimized. Three algorithms to solve... which is best.  Use cvxopt to implement one of them.

 - **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman** (Josh): implement elliptic curve cryptosystem... Diffie-Hellman.  Koblitz book on this.


## Won't be presenting

I'm not going to force anybody to give a presentation.  If you don't feel like presenting for any personal reason, that's OK, and will not negatively impact your grade.
